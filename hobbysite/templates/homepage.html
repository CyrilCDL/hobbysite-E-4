                    <p>You and your friends have varying hobbies and interests and you, as a developer, decided to create an application for your friends. They want to showcase their arts and crafts, original works, analysis, discussions, and create a community that helps each other foster their hobbies. With this, you decided to create a hobby site. The goal is to create applications on the site that will show a merchandise store, a wiki, a blog, a forum, and a commission board. After a bit more work, you decided to expand this site to include user inputs and functionalities to expand your user base.
